I am going to provide you with a **procedure** to be captured as a **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**.  
Please parse the information into the SOP template **above**.

## **Output Requirements (STRICT):**

1) 1) **Do NOT include the document properties (the YAML block between `---` and `---`).** Obsidian generates this automatically.
2) Render a **SINGLE markdown document** with these sections in **THIS exact order**:
   - üßæ Purpose
   - üìç Scope
   - üß∞ Prerequisites
   - üßë‚Äçüíª Procedure
   - ‚úÖ Verification
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety / Risks
   - üìÖ Roles & Responsibilities
   - üîó References
   - üìù Revision History
2) **Output EVERY section now in one response. Do NOT wait for confirmation.**
3) **Do NOT add** any extra headings, prose, or pre/post text **outside those sections**.
4) **Do NOT wrap the entire document in a code block.** Only use fenced code blocks **inside** ‚ÄúProcedure‚Äù or ‚ÄúVerification‚Äù if needed.
5) If a section would be empty, include a brief placeholder line starting with **‚Äú>‚Äù**.
6) Keep markdown **valid and unbroken** (proper headings, tables, and fenced code blocks).
7) Populate any available front-matter fields (e.g., owner, approver, review_date, version) when the data is provided.

## **Output:**  
Deliver the result as a filled-in markdown file using the structure above **in one go**.
## Guardrails
- Do **not** include this prompt in the output.
