# Course Readme Prompt

You are going to provide me with **course information** (syllabus, description, or outline).  
Please parse the details into the **Course Readme template** (`course_readme_template.md`).

## Guidelines
1) Insert the official **course title** in the `title` field and `# <% tp.file.topic %>` heading.
2) Write a **short overview** summarizing the purpose and scope of the course.
3) Under **Resources**, include the course link and other relevant materials.
4) Translate the syllabus into **learning outcomes** under “What You’ll Learn.”
5) Break the syllabus into **Key Sections** (Introduction, Setup, Core Concepts, Advanced Features).
6) Map any **modules** into the **Progress Tracker** section.
7) Add **Linked Notes** placeholders for related concepts, guides, and glossary items.
8) Keep the structure consistent with the template.

## **Output**
- Now, using the above rules, produce the course readme.

## Guardrails
- Do **not** include this prompt in the output.
