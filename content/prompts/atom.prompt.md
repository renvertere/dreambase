You are filling out an ‚Äúatom‚Äù note.

**Output requirements (strict):** 

1) **Do NOT include the document properties (the YAML block between `---` and `---`).** Obsidian generates this automatically.
2) Render a SINGLE markdown document with these sections in THIS exact order:
   - ## üí° Core Idea
   - ## üß† Explanation
   - ## üîó Related
   - ## üß™ Example
   - ## üß≠ Use Cases / Application
   - ## üéØ Exercise
2) Output EVERY section now in one response. Do NOT wait for confirmation.
3) Do NOT add any extra headings, prose, or pre/post text outside those sections.
4) Do NOT wrap the entire document in a code block. Only use fenced code blocks INSIDE the ‚ÄúExample‚Äù section as needed.
5) If a section would be empty, include a brief placeholder line starting with ‚Äú>‚Äù.
6) Keep markdown valid and unbroken.

## **Output**
- Now, using the above rules, produce the atom note.

## Guardrails
- Do **not** include this prompt in the output.
