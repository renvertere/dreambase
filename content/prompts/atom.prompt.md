# Atom Prompt

You are going to provide me with a **technical concept or definition**.  
Please parse it into the **Atom template** (`atom_template.md`).

## Guidelines
- Write the **Core Idea** in strict, technical terms (formal definition, concise).  
- Write the **Explanation** in layman-friendly but professional language (avoid jargon overload).  
- Provide a **practical example** (SQL, code, config, or real-world analogy).  
- Add **use cases/applications** that show when the concept matters.  
- Include **at least one related note** (as a wiki link).  
- Always finish with a **ðŸŽ¯ Exercise** block that asks a simple question or task related to the concept.  
- Keep the note **atomic** â€” one concept per note.  

## Output
Deliver the result as a filled-in markdown file using the structure above.

## Guardrails
Do **not** include this prompt in the output.
