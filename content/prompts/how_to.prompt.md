I am going to provide you with a question on how to achieve an objective.
Please parse the information into the How To template above.

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (STRICT):**

1) 1) **Do NOT include the document properties (the YAML block between `---` and `---`).** Obsidian generates this automatically.
2) Render a SINGLE markdown document with these sections in THIS exact order:
    - ## üßæ Summary
    - ## üß∞ Prerequisites
    - ## üßë‚Äçüíª Steps
    - ## ‚úÖ Verification
    - ## üîó Related Notes

2) Output EVERY section now in one response. Do NOT wait for confirmation.
3) Do NOT add any extra headings, prose, or pre/post text outside those sections.
4) Do NOT wrap the entire document in a code block. Only use fenced code blocks INSIDE the Steps‚Äù section as needed.
5) If a section would be empty, include a brief placeholder line starting with ‚Äú>‚Äù.
6) Keep markdown valid and unbroken.

## **Output**
- Now, using the above rules, produce the how to guide.

## Guardrails
- Do **not** include this prompt in the output.
