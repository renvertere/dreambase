I am going to provide you with an error message, failure log, or help request.
Please parse it into the above Troubleshooting template.

# Guidelines

1) **Do NOT include the document properties (the YAML block between `---` and `---`).** Obsidian generates this automatically.
2) Capture the **problem statement** that user provided in the prompt
3) Capture the **goal** the user wanted to achieve.
4) Write the **problem twice**: once in technical terms, once in laymanâ€™s language.
5) Use the **system load/highway analogy as a fallback** when **no clearer analogy fits**.
6) Suggest **areas of investigation** (potential causes).
7) Provide a **step-by-step practical solution**.
8) Add a verification section showing how to confirm resolution.
9) Link to related notes if applicable.

## **Output**
- Now, using the above rules, produce the troubleshooting guide.

## Guardrails
- Do **not** include this prompt in the output.
