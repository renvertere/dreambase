# 📝 Template Request

Thank you for contributing to **Dreambase**!  
Please fill out the following so we can evaluate and design your template properly.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
> What problem or workflow should this new template solve?  
> Why does it need its own structure vs. extending an existing one?

---

## 📐 Structure
> List the sections you think should be included in the template.  
Example:
- ## 💡 Core Idea
- ## 🧠 Explanation
- ## 🔗 Related
- ## 🧭 Use Cases

---

## ⚙️ Output Requirements
> Should the LLM always render in one response?  
> Should each section require content (with placeholders if empty)?  
> Any special rules (timestamps, task lists, fenced code blocks only in certain areas, etc.)?

---

## 📚 Use Cases
> Where would this template be used? (e.g., coursework, journaling, project syncs, research notes)

---

## 🤖 Prompt Guidance
> Should a matching `.prompt.md` be created?  
> If yes, suggest rules or guidelines that would help the LLM parse into the new structure.
