# # 🌌 DreamBase

**Dreambase** is a collection of standardized **Markdown templates** and **prompts** for structured note-taking and learning — designed for use in **Obsidian** or any general Markdown workflow.  
The goal is to enforce **consistency**, **clarity**, and **automation-friendly formatting** across diverse knowledge capture contexts — whether you’re **drawing in crayon**, studying **nuclear physics**, or building **sophisticated knowledge-base SOPs**.

Dreambase is developed and maintained by the team at the charity **DreamScape3^ VL (Virtual Learning)**.

## 📋 Prompts
Each template has a matching `.prompt.md` stored under `content/prompts/`.  
These prompts enforce **Guidelines** for the LLM when parsing raw inputs (transcripts, outlines, workflows) into structured notes.

Prompts enforce:  
- Technical vs layman explanations.  
- Timestamp validation.  
- Linking related notes.  
- Consistent atomic scope.  

- `atom.prompt.md` → For atomic technical concepts.  
- `course_readme.prompt.md` → For course outlines.  
- `how_to.prompt.md` → For step-by-step guides.  
- `meeting_transcript.prompt.md` → For meeting transcripts.  
- `video_transcript.prompt.md` → For video transcripts.  
- `journal_logs.prompt.md` → For daily journaling.  
- `exercise_q.prompt.md` → For exercise questions.  
- `standard_op_proc_prompt.md` → For Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

## 📜 LLM_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md

This file acts as the **control layer** for ChatGPT when operating inside a vault created from Dreambase.  
It ensures template isolation, consistent formatting, and correct use of prompts.

### 🛠️ How to use it

When creating a new ChatGPT project folder:

1. Copy `LLM_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` into the root of your vault.
2. Open the file and replace `<vault-name>` in the YAML section with the name of your vault/project.
    - Example: change `name: <vault-name>` → `name: MyLearningVault`

3. In ChatGPT project settings, **paste the following sections** from `LLM_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:
    - 📐 **Rules**
    - 🎛️ **Response Convention**
    - ⚙️ **YAML Control Layer**


These sections tell ChatGPT how to:
- Stay isolated to your vault’s templates.
- Map keywords (e.g., _Explain_, _Guide_, _Practice_, _etc_) to the correct template + prompt pairing.
- Format all generated content consistently.


### ⚠️ Important
Do **not** paste the explanatory text from `LLM_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` into ChatGPT — it’s for humans only.  
ChatGPT only needs the **rules + mappings**.

---

## 🔢 Numbering Conventions
- **Exercises**:  
  - Questions → `exercise_Q01.md`, `exercise_Q02.md`  
  - Answers → `exercise_A01.md`, `exercise_A02.md`  
- **Atoms**: One concept per note, linked to exercises.  
- **Projects**: Incremental numbering for grouped learning paths (e.g., `A01 – What is Ansible`).  

---

## 🔗 Suggested Workflow
1. **Atom** → Capture atomic concepts.
2. **Exercise Q/A** → Practice comprehension.
3. **How To** → Record repeatable workflows.
4. **Troubleshooting** → Diagnose and resolve unexpected errors or failures, linking back to related Atoms and How-To notes.
5. **Meeting/Video Transcripts** → Extract structured knowledge from real-time content.
6. **Course Readme** → Track structured learning journeys.
7. **Dashboard** → Central navigation hub.

# 📦 Usage

## ⚙️ Helper Script: Create a New Obsidian Vault

You can use the following shell alias function to quickly spin up a new Obsidian vault with the correct base folder structure and templates.

```bash
function makeobsvault() {
  if [ -z "$1" ] || [ -z "$2" ]; then
    echo "Usage: makeobsvault <vault-name> <dreambase-repo-dir>"
    echo "Example: makeobsvault MyVault ~/path/to/Dreambase"
    return 1
  fi

  VAULT_NAME="$1"
  DB_REPO="$2"

  echo "📁 Creating Obsidian Vault: $VAULT_NAME"
  mkdir -p "$VAULT_NAME"/{content,resources/img,src}
  mkdir -p "$VAULT_NAME"/content/{certificates,comments,exercises/{questions,answers},knowledgebase/{atoms,how_to,journal_logs,transcripts/{meetings,video_tutorials}},prompts,templates}

  echo "📄 Copying templates & prompts..."
  cp -R "$DB_REPO/content/templates"/* "$VAULT_NAME/content/templates/"
  cp -R "$DB_REPO/content/prompts"/*   "$VAULT_NAME/content/prompts/"

  echo "⚙️ Copying Obsidian config & plugins..."
  cp -R "$DB_REPO/.obsidian" "$VAULT_NAME/.obsidian"

  echo "✅ Vault '$VAULT_NAME' created successfully with Dreambase templates and config."
}
```


```bash
makeobsvault MyVault ~/path/to/Dreambase_repo
```

- **`vault-name`** → The name of your new Obsidian vault (will be created in the current directory).
- **`templates-source-dir`** → Path to your templates directory (where this repo is cloned).
    

This allows you to keep your **source templates** anywhere and generate vaults in any location without modifying the function.

### Key Notes:

- **`dreambase-repo-dir`** should point to the root of your cloned Dreambase repo.
- The script now **copies `.obsidian`** (plugins + config) alongside templates/prompts.
- Result: you open the new vault in Obsidian and everything (Templater, Dataview, mappings) is pre-configured.
