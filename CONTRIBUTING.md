## 📐 Design Principles

- **Atomic** → Each template should capture one clear workflow or note type.
- **Strict Sections** → Use clearly defined headings. Always include placeholders if content is missing.
- **Prompt-Driven** → Every template should have (or be compatible with) an accompanying prompt.
- **Consistency** → Use the same markdown style across all templates.
- **Automation-Ready** → Avoid loose formatting. Notes must be LLM-parseable and Git-friendly.
